RAG Technology Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. RAG systems work by:

1. Retrieving relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base
2. Using the retrieved information as context for a language model
3. Generating responses based on both the retrieved context and the model's training

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual documents
- Enables up-to-date information without retraining the model
- Provides transparency through source attribution
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning large models

Key Components:
- Document Loader: Ingests and processes documents
- Text Splitter: Breaks documents into manageable chunks
- Embeddings: Converts text into numerical representations
- Vector Store: Efficiently stores and retrieves embeddings
- Language Model: Generates human-like responses
- Retrieval Chain: Orchestrates the retrieval and generation process

RAG is widely used in chatbots, question-answering systems, and knowledge management applications.
